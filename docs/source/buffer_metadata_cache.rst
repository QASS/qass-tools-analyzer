BufferMetadataCache
*******************


The Metadata class can be used in order to organize lot's of Buffer files. 
For example you might have a project generated by the Analyzer4D Software and you want to search through all buffer files
in order to find all buffers with a certain compression.
You could go through each file and check out if the compression matches your requirement which takes a lot of time.
The cache creates a database that caches all the metadata available in the :class:`qass.tools.analyzer.buffer_parser.Buffer` class.
You can then query the cache very fast and programmatically in Python!
