Overview
********

The :class:`Buffer` class can be used to open measurement data files that are generated by the Analyzer4D software.
It can be used to access the Metadata of those files like process number, channel etc. and the actual measurement data.
It can be used together with the :class:`BufferMetadataCache` to organize large amounts of buffer files.


Example
*******
In the example we provide the path to a buffer file to the :class:`Buffer` class and use the with-statement to open it to read the process number.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

     from qass.tools.analyzer.buffer_parser import Buffer

     buffer_file = "path/to/my/buffer_file"
     with Buffer(buffer_file) as buff:
        print(buff.process)


Buffer
******

The :class:`Buffer` can be used to open measurement files created by the analyzer4D software

.. autoclass:: qass.tools.analyzer.buffer_parser.Buffer
        :members:


Filter buffers
**************

.. autofunction:: qass.tools.analyzer.buffer_parser.filter_buffers


.. warning::
        This is deprecated! It's highly recommended to use the :class:`qass.tools.analyzer.buffer_metadata_cache.BufferMetadataCache` instead.
